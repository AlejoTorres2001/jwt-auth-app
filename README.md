  **this is the master branch for the client code of this implementation of a *jwt auth strategy***
  

</div>

Both **Backend** and **Frontend** should be considered as separated projects each one with its dependencies. if you are about to contribute to this project or just to play around with the code I suggest cloning each master branch in different folders

## About The Project

a simple react app with aregistration and login forms and various protected routes yhat checks for authentication and authorization/roles of the user logged in grantting (or not) access to them.
I would like to point out that the session of the user is handled inside the memory of the client (state) using the ContextAPI, only storing the refreshToken in a HTTPS-only cookie.
I'm using LocalStorage just to handle the check of a trust device.
