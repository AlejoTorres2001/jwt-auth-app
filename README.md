**this is the master branch for the server-side code of this implementation of a *jwt auth strategy***

</div>

Both **Backend** and **Frontend** should be considered as separated projects each one with its dependencies. if you are about to contribute to this project or just to play around with the code I suggest cloning each master branch in different folders

For handling **the authorization for each route** I'm using *middlewares* that check the authorization header in each request as well as the origin to handle CORS accordingly
